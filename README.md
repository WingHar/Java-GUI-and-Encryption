# Java-GUI-and-Encryption
Java code for creating an encryption and decryption filing program using JavaFX

Project Details
---------------
This project utilizes a simple Caesar cipher. In a Caesar cipher, each character in a message is shifted forwards or backwards on the ASCII/Unicode table based on a shift value. For this project, a shift value of 10 is to be used.
This project is written entirely in Java and the GUI (Graphical User Interface) is created using JavaFX.
